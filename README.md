# Project Nutrition

## Description

In this project, I leverage the Open Food Facts database to develop a web app aimed at helping users find healthier food options based on various nutritional factors such as Nutriscore score, protein content, sugar content, and fiber content, etc... 

The app is available for users for now in a few selected countries including France, Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom. 

The project also involves image classification to assist users in identifying product categories and receiving recommendations for healthier food alternatives.
