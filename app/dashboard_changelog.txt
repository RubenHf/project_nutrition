-Improvement of calculs: products by countries, product by pnns_groups. Calcul structure is now more efficient, we 10 to 100x faster calcul. We could take 10 sec to calculate the number of products for the United States, now it is below the second
-Caching was added for rendering dataframe. It means, if some groups of products were already search, it will be faster to load. It is on server side, so one person only need to load, for everyone to be have the benefit 
-Change on how the data was stored and used across the dashboard. Initial thoughts were on using multiple dcc.store to store some slices of data. But it was costing on storage and in speed of transfert data across the dash. Now, we use
the global data and query it when necessary (caching helping). Overall it improved everything
-Usage of patching was extend to all figures and configurations. Showing modified figure (slider effect, selected products) is faster by a factor 10 to 100.

When the user sort manually the dashtable, a "personnalized plan" is save for the user. When he changes back to a preset plan, he can come back to this one.
